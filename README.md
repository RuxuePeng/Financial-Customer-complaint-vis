### [Project Description](doc/)
+ Project title: Which are the states that have the most financial complaints each year?
+ This project is conducted by *Ruxue Peng, Columbia UNI: rp2815*

+ Project summary:  
  I approach the question by visualizing the dataset provided by data.gov, the Consumer Complaint Database. I cleaned the data, format the data and feed it to a new package I've found, called "rMaps". I used it to create a interactive choropleth map that allows user to look at the state by state count of financial complaints of each year(from 2011 to 2017).
